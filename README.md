# WACK Preview

**WACK Preview** is a WordPress plugin that helps you to implement a preview
system for unpublished drafts on your frontend application.

## How it works

Originally designed for use with the WACK Stack, this plugin can also be used
with other decoupled, headless WordPress setups that use separate frontend
applications, such as those utilizing the REST API or WPGraphQL.

This plugin replaces the default permalinks and preview links for posts (and
other custom post types) generated by WordPress.

Preview links are generated with a JWT token as a parameter. By verifying this
JWT using the same secret key on your frontend application, you can ensure the
token was legitimately generated by WordPress. This lets you securely fetch data
before it is published.

## Installation

- Requires PHP 8.1 or later
- Requires WordPress 6.7 or later
- Requires Composer

### Using Composer

```bash
composer require kodansha/wack-preview
```

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is not available on the WordPress.org plugin repository.
> The only installation method currently available is through Composer.

## Configuration

To use WACK Preview, you need to configure URL mappings for displaying pages on
the frontend. Additionally, you must set up a secret token for preview URLs.

You can configure these settings using one of the following methods:

- Define settings with the `WACK_PREVIEW_SETTINGS` constant
- Configure settings through the WordPress admin menu

### Setting via WACK_PREVIEW_SETTINGS constant

Define `WACK_PREVIEW_SETTINGS` in functions.php or similar:

```php
define('WACK_PREVIEW_SETTINGS', [
    // URL of frontend
    'frontend_base_url' => 'https://frontend.example.com',
    // Preview token settings
    'preview_token' => [
        // Secret key for Token generation
        'secret_key' => 'THIS_IS_A_SECRET_KEY',
        // Expiry time of token (seconds)
        'expiry_time' => 60 * 60 * 24
    ],
    // Path mappings for publish and preview links
    // %id% will be replaced with the actual post id when generating links
    // e.g. /post/%id% -> /post/123
    // The generated links will replace the original links
    'path_mappings' => [
        // Mapping for each post types
        // This example is for the default "post" type
        'post' => [
            'publish' => '/posts/%id%',
            'preview' => '/posts/preview/%id%'
        ],
        // Another custom post type you would like to rewrite permalinks
        'news' => [
            'publish' => '/news/%slug%',
            // You can set a preview path including query string
            // query strings will be merged with "preview_token" and "preview"
            'preview' => '/news/preview?slug=%slug%'
        ],
    ],
]);
```

> [!NOTE]
> On multisite WordPress installations, the WACK_PREVIEW_SETTINGS constant does
> not function as expected. In such cases, configure settings individually for
> each site using the admin menu.

### Setting via WordPress admin menu

Navigate to the WACK Preview settings screen in the WordPress admin menu and
follow the on-screen instructions.

> [!TIP]
> If settings are defined in both the `WACK_PREVIEW_SETTINGS` constant and the
> admin menu, the constant's settings will take precedence. This allows flexible
> configuration - for example, you could define only the `secret_key` as a
> constant (keeping it out of the database) while managing other settings
> through the admin screen.
